Data Generating Process
    Configure treatment effect heterogeneity, independent of regression form and sample size

Params:
    effect_type - heterogeneous vs homogeneous
    effect_homogenous - if effect_type is homogenous, controls what the treatment coefficient is
    effect_heterogenous - if effect_type is heterogenous, controls n where the treatment coefficient is 1 + n * x_2 * x_5
    treatment_probability - probability that an observation is assigned the treatment, default is 0.5
    order - order of interactions between covariates desired, as order is increased, number of covariates and nonlinearity (if specified) is also increased
    linear - flag to control whether the dgp has exponents larger than 1 
    cc - number of continuous covariates to be included (pre-introduction of n order interactions)
    N - sample size
    rho - variance between continuous covariates
Returns: y, X, betas, features
